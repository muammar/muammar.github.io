              Responsibilities include:
              * Report to the lead for Predictive Sciences of the IPS organization;
                scenarios involve a range of datasets and learning objectives, including
                drug discovery, multi-modal modeling, uncertainty quantification,
                and predictive models for chemical and biological datasets.
                * Formulation and implementation of predictive modeling and machine learning
                solutions for optimizing chemical structures, drug-target interactions, and
                physicochemical properties.
                * Application of cutting-edge machine learning (deep learning) approaches to
                physicochemical property predictions and molecular interaction challenges.
                * Work alongside experts in similar applications of machine learning in the
                biotechnology domain, including:
                  1. Collaboration to develop human-in-the-loop systems to capture and
                  operationalize machine learning datasets and algorithms used by BMS
                  scientists.
                  2. Application of supervised and semi-supervised deep learning methods
                  to derive robust, generalizable, and reusable representations for chemical
                  and biological assay data.
                  3. Design of multi-task, multi-modal, and generative neural network
                  learning approaches to tackle real-world drug discovery optimization
                  problems.
                * Pursue leading research in applied scientific machine learning that
                demonstrates the value of predictive methods to accelerate and optimize
                drug development.
                * Derive and apply predictive approaches in collaboration with BMS
                colleagues in the Informatics Predictive Sciences and Chemistry
                departments.
                * Apply rigorous internal standards for applied machine learning practice,
                including evaluation of methods, approaches, and solutions.
                * Present strategies, techniques, results, and conclusions to BMS
                colleagues and external audiences.
                * Enable strategic collaborations with academic and commercial
                collaborators to benefit therapeutic programs. I am the BMS
                representative before the “Machine Learning for Pharmaceutical Discovery
                and Synthesis Consortium” collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute
                of Technology. For more information, see https://mlpds.mit.edu/.
                * Implement and apply uncertainty quantification of predictive models to steer scientific discovery.
                * Supervise and mentor interns to develop their careers and benefit
                therapeutic programs at BMS.

              Responsibilities include:
              * Developed a Python library to ease the deployment of machine learning models for chemistry and
                materials sciences. https://github.com/muammar/ml4chem. This package is helping us advance our
                research faster because we can consistently implement new methods.
              * Developed a neural network model that can learn how to predict retention times from chromatography
                data. These models can be used by experimentalists to get insights about the substances they study
                without explicitly running the experiments.
              * Applied autoencoders to extract features and systematically studied their topology to understand their
                effect on the predictive power of models used for material sciences.
              * Generated data sets using web-scraping and diversified their variance with active learning techniques.
              * Worked on a project for Scaling Interactive Science for Data-Intensive Discovery for the Linac Coherent
                Light Source (LCLS) at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory.
              * Led and designed research projects executed by summer interns.
              * Wrote scientific publications to show our results to the community.

                to decrease orders of magnitude of the computational time needed by the simulations.
              * Was actively involved in the development of the Atomistic Machine-learning Package (Amp) created
                and maintained by the Catalyst Design Laboratory at Brown University 
                https://bitbucket.org/andrewpeterson/amp.
              * Implemented kernel ridge regression within an atom-centered mode in their machine-learning package.
