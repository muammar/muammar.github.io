Muammar is a Principal Scientist in Chemical Informatics and Machine Learning
applying data-driven models to solve problems in drug discovery at Odyssey
Therapeutics. His research interests include machine learning, physical
chemistry, and software solutions.

He is a chemist by training from the University of Zulia in Venezuela and
started his graduate studies with a European Master in Theoretical Chemistry
and Computational modeling of the Erasmus Mundus Program. His Ph.D. in
theoretical chemical physics was about the characterization of metallic and
insulating properties of low-dimensional systems using the theory of the
insulating state of Walter Kohn applied with wave function theory.

He was a postdoctoral research associate at Brown University, where he worked
in the acceleration of atomistic simulations with machine learning models in
the group of Prof. Andrew A. Peterson in the Catalyst Design Laboratory. He
acquired experience with neural networks and kernel ridge regression models
to mimic quantum mechanics simulations using interatomic machine learning
potentials in this appointment.

At Lawerence Berkeley National Laboratory, he was a postdoctoral scholar
working towards the development of machine learning approaches, algorithms
and data sets to solve chemical science problems.

His first work in the pharmaceutical field started at Bristol-Myers Squibb where
he applied machine learning to the prediction of physicochemical properties to
different assays of interest systematically studying a plethora of algorithms.
He also introduced and championed the addition of uncertain quantification as a
good practice in predictive models used for decision-making in the company,  and
multi-task learning to build more robust methods.

He has published more than ten papers, and given presentations at international
conferences, and developed the ML4Chem machine learning package, a module for
the MOLPRO quantum-chemistry package, and the atomistic machine-learning
package (Amp). Additionally, he has participated in the free software
community and is a Debian Linux developer.
